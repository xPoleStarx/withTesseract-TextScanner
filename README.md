## Text Recognition System using OpenCV and Tesseract OCR

This system allows you to perform text recognition on an image using OpenCV and the Tesseract OCR (Optical Character Recognition) engine. It extracts text from an image and displays the recognized text as output.

📝 **Step-by-Step Algorithm:**

1. 📷 **Image Selection**: The user is prompted to enter the file path of the image they want to process.

2. 🖼️ **Image Loading**: The system uses the OpenCV library to load the image specified by the user.

3. ⚙️ **Tesseract Configuration**: The system configures the Tesseract OCR engine by setting the path to the Tesseract executable.

4. 🔍 **Text Recognition**: The system performs text recognition on the loaded image using the `image_to_string` function from the pytesseract module. This function extracts the text from the image.

5. 📜 **Text Output**: The recognized text is stored in the `text` variable.

6. 🖨️ **Text Display**: The system prints the recognized text to the console using the `print` function.

🚀 **Example Execution:**

Let's walk through an example execution of this system:

1. The system asks the user to provide the file path of the image they want to process.

2. The user enters the image file path: `/path/to/image.jpg`

3. The system loads the image using OpenCV.

4. Tesseract OCR engine is configured with the appropriate executable path.

5. Text recognition is performed on the image, and the recognized text is stored in the `text` variable.

6. The system prints the recognized text to the console.

   ```
   Enter the image file path: /path/to/image.jpg
   Hello, world! This is an example text.
   ```

📝 **Note**: To run this system, you need to have OpenCV and pytesseract installed. Additionally, make sure to replace `/path/to/tesseract.exe` with the correct path to the Tesseract executable for your system.

That's it! You can now use this system to extract text from images using OpenCV and Tesseract OCR. Have fun exploring and applying it to various use cases! 🚀🔍
